# Super-Mario-World-NES

## I'm making Super Mario World for the NES, because the Hummer Team made Super Mario World for the NES but it was bad. So I'm making this in 8bitworkshop IDE in C, because I refuse to use NESMaker, because I'm not paying 36$. And I need help for: coding, graphics, sound, level designing and map designing.

If someone wants to help, contact me on Discord: @Computerairo
